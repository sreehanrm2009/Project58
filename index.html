        <p>My favourite hobby is playing chess. Chess is a logical game, unlike the luck-based snake and ladder and ludo. Chess tests our reasoning and thinking skills and can be played anytime, anywhere. Chess has been one of the most popular indoor sports for a long time and will remain so. A game of chess also represents a lifetime.</p>
